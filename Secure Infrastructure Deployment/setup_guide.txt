- Create a new VCN in your compartment.
- Configure CIDR blocks and subnets (public and private).

#### Internet Gateway
- Set up an Internet Gateway for public internet access.

### 3. Compute Resources
#### Launching an Instance
- Launch a compute instance in the public subnet.
- Configure the instance with essential packages and settings.

### 4. Data Storage
#### Block Volume
- Create and attach a block volume to the compute instance.
- Format and mount the block volume.

### 5. Monitoring
#### OCI Monitoring Service
- Set up basic alarms for resource health monitoring.
- Configure notifications for triggered alarms.

### 6. Cleanup
- Instructions on safely terminating resources after use to avoid unnecessary charges.
