Security Best Practices for OCI Deployment

This document outlines the security best practices implemented in Project 1 for deploying a secure cloud infrastructure on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

1. Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) with IAM
- Description: Grant only the permissions necessary to perform a task.
- Implementation in Project 1:
  Created user groups with specific roles.
  Attached policies to groups based on their responsibilities.

2. Compartmentalization
- Description: Use compartments to isolate resources.
- Implementation in Project 1: 
  Created a separate compartment for the project to ensure resources are isolated from the root and other compartments.

3. Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) Configuration
- Description: Properly configure VCNs to ensure network security.
- Implementation in Project 1:
  Deployed a VCN with proper CIDR block.
  Created public and private subnets to segregate resources.
  Configured an Internet Gateway for public access, ensuring only necessary resources are exposed.

4. Security Lists and Network Security Groups
- Description: Control inbound and outbound traffic to resources.
- Implementation in Project 1:
  - Configured security lists to allow SSH access only from specific IPs.
  - Allowed all outbound traffic to ensure the instance can communicate with necessary services.

5. Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) with IAM
- Description: Grant only the permissions necessary to perform a task.
- Implementation in Project 1:
  - Created user groups with specific roles.
  - Attached policies to groups based on their responsibilities.

6. Data Encryption
- Description: Encrypt data at rest and in transit.
- Implementation in Project 1:
  - OCI ensures data encryption at rest for all storage services.
  - Data in transit is encrypted using protocols like TLS.

7. Monitoring and Alerts
- Description: Monitor resources and set up alerts for anomalies.
- Implementation in Project 1:
  - Used OCI Monitoring to set up alarms for CPU and memory usage.
  - Configured notifications to be sent to a specific email when alarms are triggered.

8. SSH Key Pair for Instances
- Description: Use SSH key pairs for secure access to instances.
- Implementation in Project 1:
  - Generated and used an SSH key pair for accessing the compute instance, ensuring only authorized users can access.

Note: This document provides an overview of the security measures implemented in Project 1. Always refer to OCI's official documentation for a comprehensive list of best practices and ensure you stay updated with the latest security recommendations.
